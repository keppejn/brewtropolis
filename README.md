# ☕️ Brewtropolis

Welcome to Brewtropolis — a retro 80s-themed coffee shop portfolio site where code meets caffeine. This project blends vaporwave visuals with modern front-end development to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AI-assisted design.

## 🧠 Concept

Brewtropolis is a fictional café staffed by barista personas, each representing a different coding skill. Visitors can browse the coffee menu (projects), meet the team (skills), and enjoy a neon-lit experience inspired by synthwave and vaporwave aesthetics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 + Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Formspree + `fetch` for contact form integration
- Google Fonts + FontAwesome
- AI tools (Copilot, Gemini) for creative generation

## 📂 Project Highlights

- `LatteML`: AI-powered form submission
- `Vanilla JS Espresso`: Responsive design with vaporwave styling
- `Gemini Resume`: Styled resume with raw Neocities version

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

Inspired by 80s synthwave, neon skylines, and retro tech. Color palette includes electric pinks, teals, and midnight blues. Typography blends pixel fonts with modern sans-serif.
